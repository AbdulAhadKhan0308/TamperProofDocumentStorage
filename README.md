# TamperProof Document Sotrage

### IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)

It is used to store documents.

### Ethereum Blockchain

Kovan Testnet of Ethereum Blockchain stores the document hash.

### How does it work?

If document get's tampered (modified) on IPFS it's hash value will change and will not equal the value on blockchain.
Thus any tampering attempt will be caught.
